# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction 💰
Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project! In this repository, we've delved into the world of laptops 🚀. We've meticulously explored the dataset, cleaned the data, and built five powerful models 🛠️: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. 🌳 After fine-tuning the models' hyperparameters, we've achieved an impressive accuracy of 88.7%! 🎉

##Overview 📊
Explore this repository to dive deep into the insights and predictions of our laptop price prediction models. We've crafted each model with care, leveraging the latest techniques in machine learning to deliver accurate results. 🧠

##Models Used 🤖
Linear Regression: Basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.
Lasso Regression: Uses L1 regularization to penalize the absolute size of coefficients.
Ridge Regression: Uses L2 regularization to penalize the squared size of coefficients.
Decision Tree: Supervised learning algorithm that partitions the data into subsets based on the value of input features.
Random Forest: Ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training.
Results and Analysis 📈
We've meticulously evaluated each model's performance and provided detailed insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Dive into our notebook to see the predictions made by each model and how they compare to the actual prices in the dataset. 📉

##Conclusion 🎯
We hope you find this project insightful and useful for predicting laptop prices. Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it for your own projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy predicting! 🚀🔮
